* [HTTP POST](#http-post)

## Http GET
Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the resource’s state, these are said to be safe methods.

### GET API Response Codes
* 200 (OK) - If the resource is found.
* 404 (NOT FOUND) - If the resource is not found.
* 400 (BAD REQUEST) - If the request is not correctly formed.

### Example URL's
```sh 
HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users
HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users?size=20&page=5
HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123
HTTP GET http://www.appdomain.com/users/123/address
```
